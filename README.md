# 426mlproject

The purpose of this project was to use the nltk package from Python to perform sentiment analysis on some Twitter data. I am interested in the overlap of U.S. politics with religion in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I used a Twitter API to pull tweets that contained the hastag #DezNat, which stands for Deseret Nation. It is considered to be a right-wing nationalist group. How would sentiment analysis categorize these tweets?
